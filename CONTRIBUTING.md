#### PR Guidelines

- **One feature per PR** - Keep PRs focused and manageable
- **Clear description** - Explain what changes were made and why
- **Reference issues** - Link related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- **Update changelog** - Add entry under "Unreleased"
- **Pass CI checks** - Ensure all automated checks pass

4. Once approved, maintainers will merge

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Node.js 18+
node --version

# Cairo/Starknet tools
scarb --version
starkli --version
```

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/starknet-x402.git
cd starknet-x402

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start facilitator
npm run facilitator

# Terminal 2: Start resource server
npm run server

# Terminal 3: Run client examples
npm run client
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Handle errors explicitly

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Verifies a payment signature
 * @param payload - Payment data to verify
 * @param requirements - Payment requirements
 * @returns Verification result with validity status
 */
async function verifyPayment(
  payload: StarknetExactPayload,
  requirements: PaymentRequirements
): Promise<VerifyResponse> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Cairo Style

- Follow Starknet best practices
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable names
- Include natspec documentation
- Consider gas optimization

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # Type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/      # Cairo contracts
â”œâ”€â”€ facilitator/    # Facilitator implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/     # Express middleware
â””â”€â”€ client/         # Client library

examples/           # Example implementations
docs/              # Documentation
scripts/           # Utility scripts
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific test file
npm test -- verifier.test.ts

# With coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage

Example:
```typescript
describe('PaymentVerifier', () => {
  it('should verify valid payment signature', async () => {
    const verifier = new StarknetVerifier(config);
    const result = await verifier.verifyExactPayment(
      validPayload,
      requirements
    );
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should reject expired payment', async () => {
    const expiredPayload = { ...validPayload, deadline: 0 };
    const result = await verifier.verifyExactPayment(
      expiredPayload,
      requirements
    );
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.invalidReason).toContain('expired');
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- Explain complex algorithms
- Include usage examples
- Document error conditions

### User Documentation

When adding features, update:
- README.md
- GETTING_STARTED.md
- API_REFERENCE.md
- Examples in `examples/`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Build process, tooling changes

Examples:
```
feat(verifier): add support for multi-sig verification

Add support for verifying payments signed by multiple
signers for enhanced security.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(settler): handle RPC timeout errors

Previously, RPC timeouts would crash the settler. Now
we retry with exponential backoff.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

For a PR to be merged, it must:

1. **Be on-topic** - Align with project goals
2. **Follow standards** - Match coding style and conventions
3. **Include tests** - Have adequate test coverage
4. **Pass CI** - All automated checks must pass
5. **Have documentation** - Include relevant docs updates
6. **Be reviewed** - Approved by at least one maintainer
7. **Be secure** - No security vulnerabilities
8. **Be performant** - Not significantly degrade performance

### Payment Schemes

When adding new payment schemes:

1. Must not allow facilitator to move funds arbitrarily
2. Must include signature verification
3. Must prevent replay attacks
4. Must handle edge cases (expiry, insufficient balance, etc.)
5. Must be well-documented with examples
6. Must include comprehensive tests

## Project Structure

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create an issue describing the feature
2. Discuss implementation approach
3. Create feature branch: `feature/description`
4. Implement with tests
5. Update documentation
6. Submit PR

### Modifying Core Protocol

Changes to core protocol require:
- Discussion with maintainers
- Backwards compatibility plan
- Migration guide if breaking
- Extensive testing
